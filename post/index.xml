      <description>Solving the Wrong Problem When you need to solve a problem and you only have a vague description of that problem, the best strategy is to first gather more information about what the problem really is, rather than deeply investing in the design of a sophisticated solution. A great example of this approach to problem solving was described by Aza Raskin in his blog on the development of the first human-powered airplane to cross the English channel.</description>

      <description>In this note we describe by an example the research scope and mission of BIASlab.
Example: a hearing aid design problem Consider a situation where a person (named Sarah) is having coffee at a lunch cafe. Sarah wears hearing aids (HA), but due to other conversations across the room, she has trouble understanding Mark who sits about 3 ft away from her.
It is not clear to Sarah how to improve the situation through changing some settings of her HAs.</description>
