      <description>You are challenged to design an agent that learns to solve the cocktail party problem through on-the-spot interactions with a (human) listener. The cocktail party problem refers to the issue of not being able to understand your conversation partner in the presence of many simultaneously competing voices (Fig.1).
Sound signals from multiple conversations mix at a cocktail party. The learning protocol is displayed in Fig.2. A listener wears earbuds that are capable to process audio signals in real-time (like hearing aids).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement Football has been the world&amp;rsquo;s most popular sport for decades, and over time the game has evolved significantly. In order to search for an edge, Football clubs have started to adopt promising data analytics techniques. Consequently, the evolution of the game is pushed even further [1]. The goal of this project was to build an assistive tool that could help coaches to simulate the actions of an “optimally behaving” defending team in response to attackers.</description>

      <description>My general long-term research goal is to develop fully autonomous agents that can solve real-world problems. Specifically, I aim to build agents that can control robots to automatically perform tasks, thus reducing the workload that was previously handled by humans. In order for the agent to become fully autonomous, it must be able to make decisions in real-time. Often, such decisions must be made under uncertainty due to numerous unknown factors in its dynamic environment.</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The idea of autonomously operating (&amp;ldquo;self-learning&amp;rdquo;) information processing agents has recently gained traction in the AI research community. Depending on context, the development of these agents involves some hard challenges including the need for the agents to be capable of learning specific goals in dynamic real-world.
In this project we investigated a novel solution approach to the design of autonomous agents. We recognize that any &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; autonomously operating agent needs to be minimally capable of realizing three tasks:</description>

      <description>My research interests lie in the fields of computers science, machine learning and probabilistic programming. Currently I am a PhD candidate in the SPS group of Electrical Engineering department in Eindhoven University of Technology. I&amp;rsquo;m working on a high-performant implementation of message passing-based Bayesian inference package in the Julia programming language. My research project focuses on Signal Processing and Active inference applications, but is also aimed to expand the scope of possible applications for message passing in general.</description>

      <description>This course covers the fundamentals of a Bayesian (i.e., probabilistic) approach to machine learning and information processing systems. The Bayesian approach allows for a unified and consistent treatment of many model-based machine learning techniques. We focus on Linear Gaussian systems and will discuss many useful models and applications, including common regression and classification methods, Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models and Kalman filters. We will discuss important algorithms for parameter estimation in these models including the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Variational Bayes (VB).</description>

      <description>Problem Statement The goal of scientific modeling is to find increasingly better models for given datasets. While the proposal of a new model is inherently human (creative) work, the right choice of framework may allow for automated derivation of efficient algorithms for model fitting and performance evaluation. Bayesian (probabilistic) reasoning offers such a principled framework for model specification, fitting and criticism [1]. Moreover, for a large class of models, Bayesian inference can be automatically derived.</description>

      <description>Intelligent behaviour fascinates me: how animals can efficiently process a flood of sensory signals and learn to survive. Nature has produced elegant solutions for information processing that I believe can help us tackle challenges in modern society. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about taking what we know from how brains process information, to making intelligent machines.
My work focuses on designing agents to control walking robots. I collaborate with other researchers to study how neuro-biological processes of action and perception can be used for engineering and I collaborate with industry to solve practical problems using Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.</description>

      <description>The goal is to develop an intelligent autonomous system (agent) for a SpotMicro quadruped robot (see Figure 1). The agent must learn to walk: it will not be given an accurate model of its legs&amp;rsquo; kinematics but will have to gradually build a locomotion model from interaction with its environment. You will use Active Inference (AIF), a probabilistic machine learning framework from the computational neuroscience community, to design and train the agent.</description>

      <title>Our Approach to Solving Difficult Design Problems</title>

      <description>Solving the Wrong Problem When you need to solve a problem and you only have a vague description of that problem, the best strategy is to first gather more information about what the problem really is, rather than deeply investing in the design of a sophisticated solution. A great example of this approach to problem solving was described by Aza Raskin in his blog on the development of the first human-powered airplane to cross the English channel.</description>

      <description>In this note we describe by an example the research scope and mission of BIASlab.
Example: a hearing aid design problem Consider a situation where a person (named Sarah) is having coffee at a lunch cafe. Sarah wears hearing aids (HA), but due to other conversations across the room, she has trouble understanding Mark who sits about 3 ft away from her.
It is not clear to Sarah how to improve the situation through changing some settings of her HAs.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Modeling Approach to In-situ Trainable Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://ljwangust.github.io/project/a-probabilistic-approach-to-in-situ-trainable-gesture-recognition/</link>

      <description>Problem Statement Gesture recognition, i.e., the recognition of pre-defined gestures by arm or hand movements, enables a natural extension of the way we currently interact with devices. With the increasing amount of human-machine interactions, alternative user interfaces will become more important. Commercially available gesture recognition systems are usually pre-trained: the developers specify a set of gestures, and the user is provided with an algorithm that can recognize just these gestures. In order to improve the user experience, it is often desirable to allow users to define their own gestures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Pure-tone Audiometry</title>

      <guid>https://ljwangust.github.io/project/bayesian-pure-tone-audiometry/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement The pure-tone hearing threshold - the lowest sound intensity that a person can perceive - is usually estimated from responses to stimuli at a set of standard frequencies. At each frequency, a staircase &amp;lsquo;up 5 dB - down 10 dB&amp;rsquo; approach is used to incrementally estimate the threshold level. This simple approach however suffers from a number of drawbacks:
It does not provide an uncertainty measure for the estimated thresholds.</description>

      <guid>https://ljwangust.github.io/project/probabilistic-hearing-loss-compensation/</guid>
      <description>Problem Statement Hearing loss is a problem that affects millions of people. In order to alleviate the problem, many patients wear hearing aids that contain audio processing algorithms with lots of tuning parameters. Since hearing loss profiles are unique for each individual, it is hard to find the best hearing aid settings for a given patient, especially when unforeseen hearing problems may arise in-the-field.
We aim to automate hearing aid algorithm design under in-situ conditions and argue that a proper hearing aid design agent (HADA) should be able to support the following tasks:</description>

      <description>About BIASlab BIASlab is a research team at Eindhoven University of Technology. Our research focuses on nature-inspired (&amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo;) artificial intelligence technology for engineering applications. In particular, we are inspired by recent results in theoretical neuroscience (the Free Energy Principle) on how the brain perceives, learns and makes decisions through unsupervised real-time interactions with its environment.
Our mission is to translate these ideas to synthetic agents that automate the design of signal processing and control systems through unsupervised environmental interactions.</description>

      <description>In this project you are challenged to setup factor graph-based agents that operate simultaneously on multiple CPU cores. You will investigate the feasibility of splitting a factor graph model into multiple parts and how to run message passing-based inference in parallel using multiple CPU cores (see Figure 1). Since graph models can become quite large (e.g., millions of nodes) and data may arrive at different graph locations at different time scales, it is practically important to run these kinds of models in parallel.</description>
