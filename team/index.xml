      <description>My general long-term research goal is to develop fully autonomous agents that can solve real-world problems. Specifically, I aim to build agents that can control robots to automatically perform tasks, thus reducing the workload that was previously handled by humans. In order for the agent to become fully autonomous, it must be able to make decisions in real-time. Often, such decisions must be made under uncertainty due to numerous unknown factors in its dynamic environment.</description>

      <description>My research interests lie in the fields of computers science, machine learning and probabilistic programming. Currently I am a PhD candidate in the SPS group of Electrical Engineering department in Eindhoven University of Technology. I&amp;rsquo;m working on a high-performant implementation of message passing-based Bayesian inference package in the Julia programming language. My research project focuses on Signal Processing and Active inference applications, but is also aimed to expand the scope of possible applications for message passing in general.</description>

      <description>Intelligent behaviour fascinates me: how animals can efficiently process a flood of sensory signals and learn to survive. Nature has produced elegant solutions for information processing that I believe can help us tackle challenges in modern society. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about taking what we know from how brains process information, to making intelligent machines.
My work focuses on designing agents to control walking robots. I collaborate with other researchers to study how neuro-biological processes of action and perception can be used for engineering and I collaborate with industry to solve practical problems using Bayesian inference and probabilistic programming.</description>
